## Libraries and tools
**Visual Studio Code:** a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications<br/>
**GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060, for general computing and training the host network<br/>
**CUDA (8.0):** a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs)<br/>
**NVIDIA cuDNN (5.1):** a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks<br/>
**Keras:** an open-source neural-network library<br/>
**Tensorflow:** a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks<br/>
**NumPy:** a library for adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays<br/>
**Pandas:** for data manipulation and analysis<br/>
